# AutomatedProcessMonitoring(APMIL)
The library containing these PowerShell scripts appears to be focused on automation and monitoring tasks within a Windows environment. Here's a description of the library:

**Name**: Automated Process Monitoring and Intervention Library (APMIL)

**Description**:
This is a collection of PowerShell scripts designed to automate various monitoring and intervention tasks within a Windows environment. It provides utilities to monitor specific processes and folder activities, and take predefined actions based on predefined conditions. The library aims to enhance system reliability and provide insights into system behavior through logging and debugging functionalities.

**Key Features**:
1. **Process Monitoring**: The library includes scripts to monitor specific processes running on a Windows system. It can check whether a process is active and take actions based on its status.

2. **Folder Activity Monitoring**: APMIL offers capabilities to monitor folder activities such as file creation, modification, or deletion. It can track the age of files and trigger actions based on specified thresholds.

3. **Intervention Actions**: The library provides predefined actions to intervene in system activities. This includes killing processes, capturing screenshots, and logging events for further analysis.

4. **Customizable Parameters**: Scripts in the library are designed with customizable parameters, allowing users to tailor monitoring and intervention behaviors to their specific requirements.

5. **Logging and Debugging**: APMIL includes logging and debugging functionalities to provide visibility into script execution and system events. Users can enable or disable debugging mode to control the level of detail in the logs.

6. **Background Execution**: Scripts can be executed as background jobs, enabling asynchronous monitoring and intervention without disrupting other system tasks.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated monitoring of critical processes to ensure system stability.
- Detection and response to unexpected system behaviors such as excessive file creation or process failures.
- Scheduled tasks for routine system maintenance and cleanup activities.
- Integration with larger automation workflows for comprehensive system management.

**Target Audience**:
- System administrators responsible for managing Windows environments.
- DevOps engineers seeking to automate system monitoring and intervention tasks.
- IT professionals looking to enhance system reliability and efficiency through automation.

**Compatibility**:
- The library is designed to run on Windows operating systems with PowerShell support.
- It may require specific permissions or access rights depending on the tasks performed by individual scripts.

**Documentation**:
- The library should include comprehensive documentation covering script usage, parameter customization, troubleshooting guidelines, and best practices for deployment.

**Version Control**:
- APMIL should be maintained under version control to track changes, manage updates, and ensure consistency across deployments.

Overall, the Automated Process Monitoring and Intervention Library provides a flexible and customizable framework for automating routine tasks and maintaining system health in Windows environments.
